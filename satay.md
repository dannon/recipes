Satay Chicken Salad (for two)
====================

* 1 small handful fresh cilantro
* 1 small handful fresh mint
* 1 Cucumber
* 1 Carrot
* 1 Head romaine or red leaf lettuce
* 1 Cup Jasmine White Rice
* 1 lb chicken
* 1/4 cup chopped peanuts

Chicken can be cutlets, tenderloins, whatever.  Cut into smaller chunks or strips like what you'd put on a salad.

Sauce/Dressing
--------------
* 1 tbsp mirin
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp Sriracha
* 1/4 cup peanut butter (we use natural creamy peanut butter usually, but chunky works great if you add a little more water in the step below)

I sometimes scale this up a little, since it soaks through the salad into the rice and is delicious.


Directions
----------

1.	Marinate chicken (after sliced into chunks or strips) with just enough soy sauce to cover when tossed, not sitting in it - 15-20m or so.
2.	Make rice (the stickier the better, don't want dry rice for this).
3.	In a nonstick pan on medium-high, heat 1 tablespoon of sesame oil until hot and then add chicken.  Chicken should take about 6-8 minutes total, shift it around so it browns on all sides and gets cooked through cooked through.
4.	Roughly chop cilantro, mint, discarding thicker stems.  Should be maybe 1/4-1/2 dry cup of each, not compressed?
5.	Matchstick (or just cut small slices) of the carrot and cucumber.
6.	Toss veggies, herbs, salad leaves together.
7.	To make the sauce, whisk all sauce ingredients together in a small bowl with 2-3 tbsp water, mixing well.  You can add more water to reach desired consistency.


On a big plate put a scoop of rice and flatten it out some, add a layer of the salad and then top with the chicken, pouring (I like a lot) the sauce over like salad dressing.  Sprinkle with chopped peanuts.
