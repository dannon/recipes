Ingredients
-----------
- 1 lb top sirloin, filet, or hanger steak (I’ve tried this with all three cuts, and it’s good with all of them) *
- salt and pepper for the meat
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 small red onion, cut in thick slices
- 3 plum tomatoes, cut in thick slices
- Bag of frozen French fries (Ore-Ida extra crispy fast-food fries are what I use)†
- 1 cup jasmine rice

Lomo Sauce
----------
- 4 tablespoons soy sauce
- 6 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 2/3 cup beef stock
- 4 teaspoons cumin

Add all this to a small sauce pot, bring to boil, and reduce until it coats the back of a spoon (sometimes I have to add a bit of cornstarch if it doesn’t thicken up in time)

Aji Sauce
---------
- Juice of 1 lime
- 1 bunch cilantro
- 1 avocado
- ½ cup Mayo 
- 1 jalapeño, deseeded
- 1-2 tsp ají amarillo paste
- A few garlic cloves
- Salt to taste

Blitz all this in a blender for the sauce (make it an hour or two ahead of time so flavors infuse). This sauce is good on everything. Make a day in advance if you want.


Directions
----------
1. I cook the steak like normal— usually with the reverse sear method— 250 degrees in the oven until the meat gets to about 95-100 degrees, then a hard sear in a cast iron until med rare. Let it rest.††
2. At the same time the steak is cooking, Boil 1 cup of jasmine rice w 1½ cups water and a pinch of salt. Cover when it comes to a boil. Reduce heat to low for 14 minutes. Uncover and fluff.
3. At the same time the rice and steak are cooking, Cook the fries in an air fryer!! (About 15 mins at 325 in my air fryer,‡ but this can differ) Season with salt.
4. After rice, fries and steak are done, cook the onion in a bit of vegetable oil over high heat, add some Lomo sauce, then add tomatoes and sauté until just a little soft.
5. Slice and plate the steak and fries. Top with onion and tomato mixture.Top that with some Lomo sauce, drizzle with some aji sauce. Add rice on side, or plate the rice with steak and fries. (Double starch is never wrong.)

Recipe Club's Notes
-------------------
- *Choose your cut of meat wisely. If you like to eat it as a steak, it’ll work here. Obviously, of these three suggestions, we recommend the hanger, but to each their own.
- † We experimented with a variety of brands to varying degrees of success. Sounds like the brand Brie likes might “fry” up the crispiest, and stand up well to being drenched in sauce.
- †† Chris tried to get cute and stir-fry everything together on a residential stove. It… didn’t work. For a family-size recipe like this, best to stick to Brie’s plan and cook everything separately.
- ‡ The Recipe Club remains skeptical of air fryers. We bought the Wirecutter recommended version and… it’s a convection oven. It didn’t do anything magical to the fries. We’ll keep experimenting, but right now we’re still unconvinced.
