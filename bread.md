Easy Focaccia (simplified from SE)
=============
500g flour
20g salt
5g instant yeast
350g water
2 Tbsp olive oil

* Use a kitchen scale and weights, way easier than measuring.

1. Mix it all up in a large bowl, just until there's no dry flour.  There should still be lumps.
2. Cover with a wet towel or plastic wrap for at least 12h.
3. Flour hands and work surface generously, pull out yeast and form into a ball, tucking seam underneath.
4. Pour the 2tbsp olive oil in a large cast iron skillet or dutch oven, add dough, cover again for 2 more hours.
5. Flatten dough while pushing to edge and popping bubbles.
6. Sprinkle with toppings (italian herb grinder is really easy, rosemary, olives, salt, etc), and drizzle with extra olive oil.
7. Bake for ~20m at 550 degrees, or until golden brown and bottom is crispy
